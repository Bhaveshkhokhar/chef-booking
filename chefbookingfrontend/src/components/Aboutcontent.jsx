            <h5>Tired of Eating Outside Every Day? We’ve Got You Covered!</h5>
            <p>
              Living in a Tier 1 city often means a fast-paced lifestyle — and
              for many students, working professionals, and bachelors, that also
              means depending on outside food that’s often unhealthy,
              repetitive, or just doesn’t feel like home. We understand how hard
              it can be to find meals that are both nutritious and comforting
              when you're away from home.
            </p>
